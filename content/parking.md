For validated parking at the Convention Center Parking Garage: Enter the garage, push the blue button, and take a white ticket. Bring your white ticket to the campus and show to the person with validation passes. You will be given a green validation "chaser" ticket. When you exit the garage, insert the white ticket into the slot and then the green ticket to open the gate. 

The campus is a short walk from the parking garage, however, there is a free shuttle service available from and to the garage when arriving and leaving the campus between the hours of 4pm-10pm when classes are in session.
