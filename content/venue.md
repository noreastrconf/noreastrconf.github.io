### Getting to Providence

We expect most attendees to be arriving into Providence by train or car.  There are many Amtrak and MBTA Arrivals into the [Providence Station](https://www.amtrak.com/content/amtrak/en-us/stations/pvd.html).  If you are driving, there are many parking garages available near the venue.  Parking for conference attendees will be validated for those who park at the [Rhode Island Convention Center Parking Garage](http://www.riconvention.com/exhibitors/directions-parking).  Just bring the ticket issued when you entered the parking garage with you and we will provide a parking validation voucher.

If you are flying in for the conference, [T.F. Green Airport](http://www.pvdairport.com/) is the closest airport and does provide MBTA trains into Providence.
